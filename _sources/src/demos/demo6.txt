``wxmpv`` -- General matplot viewer app.

Introduction
------------

``wxmpv`` is the brief of ``wx[Python] matplot[lib] viewer`` or 
``wx[Python] mat[lab] plot viewer``, is designed with the intention of
to provide the universal interface to manipulate the data files in the
plot analysis stage, basic features should be included, such as:
    * data loading/saving
    * figure plot
    * figure style tunning
    * curve fitting
    * etc.

Currently, ``wxmpv`` could be used to operate these two (2) kinds of 
``hdf5`` data that generated from ``imageviewer`` [#f1]_:
    * data saved by ``CTRL+D`` in ``imageviewer``
    * data generated from ``Autosave`` operation of ``imageviewer``

Usage Guide
-----------

Open ``wxmpv``, just like the following image shows, there are mainly two
operation sections, the top and bottom region of figure and the style
configuration panel in the right, as well as the curve fitting panel.

.. image:: ../../images/wxmpv_01.png
    :width: 500px

Click ``File > Open (CTRL+O)`` to open supported ``hdf5`` data file, 
both image and data curve should be plotted onto the figure, style
adjustment to the image and curve is possible.

    :width: 500px

For example, when tunning the curve styles, push ``Hide Image`` to hide
the image temporarily, and click ``Set Line ID`` to select the line to
adjust the style, valid options: line color, line width, line style, 
marker color, marker size, marker style, etc.; while the image could be 
adjusted with different type of color maps and color ranges, to meet the
users' demanding.

.. image:: ../../images/wxmpv_03.png
    :width: 500px
.. image:: ../../images/wxmpv_04.png
    :width: 500px

The figure could be saved as ``eps``, ``ps``, ``png``, etc. Other options
could be tried by the users.

.. todo:: ``wxmpv`` should be extended to support more data plotting
    functionality, so as to serve as to be the general-purpose data
    plotting and manipulation app.


Shortcut: ``CTRL+S`` would save all the data into ``hdf5`` format, 
sample file could be downloaded :download:`here <../../snippets/wxmpv_data.hdf5>`.

    .. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] ``hdf5`` data format should be first set in ``Configurations``
    menu, ``Image Data Name Extension`` and choose ``hdf5`` in 
    ``Auto save`` window.
