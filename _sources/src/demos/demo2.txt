=========

``dataworkshop`` -- Data post-processing app.


Introduction
------------

Initially, ``dataworkshop`` is created for the data processing tasks, since
not all of the tasks, especially those demanding heavy computing resources
are not required to be processed simultaneously,
so we first get all the data that may need, then filter/process by another app, that
is ``dataworkshop``'s job.

Usage Guide
-----------

Import Data Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open ``dataworkshop`` as the following image shows, ``Image Grid`` panel is the place
where imported data file generated image should be put into, in the ``Control Panel``,
operations like ``Make Animation`` (not enabled), ``Statistics`` will take the data files
that selected into ``Data Workspace`` as the input, to do specific post-processing procedures.

For example, click ``File > Open files`` or shortcut ``CTRL+O`` to import ``hdf5`` files that 
generated by ``Auto save`` operations of ``imageviewer`` app. In order to show the data files
in a more informative way, the import/open operation will first transform the data files into
images, then show in grid style, the image size could be adjusted by the ``Image Size(+/-)``
buttons, i.e. increase (``+``) or shrink (``-``); when the mouse is hovering over the image,
information will show as a tooltip, including metadata like filename, timestamp, filesize, etc.

.. note:: ``File > Add files (CTRL+A)`` can be used to continue to add data files into
    the current ``Image Grid``.

There are two approaches to add/remove data files into ``Data Workspace``:

    1. Right click the image files in ``Image Grid``, choose ``To Workspace`` menu item to add
       the selected file into ``Data Workspace``; 
    2. Right click the blank space of ``Image Grid`` panel, i.e. any space that is not occupied
       by the images, ``Add all to workspace`` and ``Remove all to workspace`` actions could be
       applied;
    3. Once the file is already added into ``Data Workspace``, then right click on the image
       should pop up ``Out Workspace`` action which would remove added file out of ``Data Workspace``.

.. note:: When right clicking the image, another available action is ``Pop up Analysis``, which 
    will show the selected image in a more vivid way, details see :ref:`wxmpv_ex`.

Post-processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the operations to the data files should be implemented in the ``Control Panel``, up to now, 
there is ``Statistics`` button available to do post-processing operations.

Push ``Statistics`` button to open the pop up window, in which, push ``Radius``, will plot the
distribution of the central positions of all the files that in ``Data Workspace``, other mathods
also could be developed to help the user to quickly understand the data, so as to make the next
step decision.
