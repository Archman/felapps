Examples and Demonstrations
===========================

Here goes through the main features that ``felapps`` provides, 
among which ``latticeviewer`` is an app based on ``beamline`` package.

.. warning::
    The operating system is Linux (64 bit), distributions that has been 
    tested: *Scientifig Linux 6.4*, *CentOS 6.4*, *Linux Mint 17.x, 18*
    (*Ubuntu 15.x, 16.x*), 
    other distros should work provided proper configurations. 
    Part of features should work in Windows OS, but not be fully tested.


In the following examples, the invocation of the apps should be one of these
approaches:

    1. Type <app name> in the terminal;
    2. Browse <app name> from ``FELApps`` system menu;
    3. Invoke ``runfelapps`` or ``appdrawer``, click <app name> from the 
       app's panel (see the following image).
